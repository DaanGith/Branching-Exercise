**_CHOCOLATE SALTED CARAMEL TART_**

This 5 ingredient salted caramel tart is rocking and will leave you looking for more! 
Caramel and chocolate, is there a better combination, we think not. We love this tart recipe so much that we 
make it even easier for you to make at home and tested it to work with only 5 ingredients. This is a great recipe to make with 
kids or if you are new to baking! The caramel is made from dates, nut butter and coconut oil and tastes so good! 
If you are going to make any cake from our 5 ingredient series this one is so good â€“ its one of the most popular cakes 
in our cafes and is healthier than traditional salted caramel tarts as its higher in fibre. We love more fibre with our cakes!
